Open Source and the Blessings of Our Epoch

The Great Commons
-----------------

Just as the Egyptians had the Sun and the Nile while the Native Americans had the infinite bounty of North American wilderness, we are blessed with a resource of unlimited bounty in our times, the great fountain of wealth we call Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).

I didn't want to say software specifically, since really it's about civilization's know-how that is (or we believe should be) freely available to anyone to learn and use.  However, computer code has the amazing characteristic of being perfectly reproducible, like DNA, at zero cost.  And like where DNA is how biological processes know what to do, the instructions of computer code coordinate everything machines around us do and how humans interact with them.  Civilization's know how, today, is very much and ever more so saved as digital information, and humans and machines are inter-dependent to coordinate all of our life-sustaining activity.

Given the world's impossibly large buffet of knowledge, it's imperative that we carefully curate what's on our plate so that we can digest a representative sample in a reasonable amount of time.  I am constantly thinking about lesson material using these following criteria:

-- Durability: the stuff you do now will still be around and widely used 30, even 60, years from now.  For example, some no-brainers: Linux and SQL are here to stay forever.

-- Usefulness: That what you learn/do now will be immediately useful to a wide variety of scenarios everywhere.  There's a good chance you'll do something new and useful at your current job.

-- Ubiquitousness: It's highly preferable that we do stuff used by any/every industry, in a variety of job functions.  Linux, for example, runs data centers, handheld devices, factory robots, and even the dashboard screen of a Tesla electric car.  Programming and data concepts I hope to introduce are simultaneously useful to programmers, business analysts, financial officers, and executives.

-- Open and Accessible: remaining faithful to the promise of Open Source, that the knowledge and tools you use are selected from the open source domain so that you do not have to pay a tax to Microsoft or whoever, and that our destiny is not thrown away if a company decides to discontinue a product.  (All those experts in Adobe Flash, for example, are S.O.L.)

The Rise of Machines
--------------------

Of course, my melancholic personality can't avoid seeing through a slightly depressing lens: that we have created these machines and we've made a Faustian deal with Automata for the comforts of life as we know it.  For this reason, it is imperative that we know how to control the machines so that our lives are not controlled by machines.

The steam rollers of machination and automation started, of course, with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid 1700s.  The Age of Information has now kicked it into high gear and it's still early in this phase.  Mastering the technology around you will help you avoid having your livelihoods run over by this Juggernaut.  If you want to make an epic narrative out of it, there's also good and evil involved, as we have heard in the news about how our newfound powers are being used against us.  At the very least, you become empowered to defend yourselves.  And whether you are lawful or chaotic, I also hope you do good with it.

The Unix Timestamp that you'll become familiar with counts seconds from midnight of January 1, 1970 -- a fairly good approximation for the beginning of the computer age.  We are about to end this year, 2013 of the Christian Era, which is in 5774 of the Jewish calendar and the 7522th year of Byzantium.  And as such the machines also have a common calendar of their own, I think it's called the Unix Epoch (or simply, "The Epoch").  When London rings in the new year, the machines will have counted 1388534400 seconds since the beginning (January 1, 1970) of their world as they know it.
