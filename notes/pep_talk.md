The Pep Talk
------------

More than a decade ago, my Intro to Programming class was a miserable experience, and I vowed never to write another line of code. Telling this to a programmer friend made him plainly livid: "They had one job! The least they could do was not make you hate it!"  It's a fair estimate to guess that I lost around 7 years of continuing learning only because I turned off that part of my brain.  And it's not like something else takes its place.  It's just a room that goes dark.

It was only when I needed to flip on some new switches to work at a bike shop -- in my case learning about how bikes work, why some are $500 vs $5000 -- that I accidentally also re-activated learning computer stuff.  And I was learning Chinese again.  So learning one thing doesn't come at the expense of learning something else.  An engaged mind is not unlike training and staying fit for a ball game.  (Disclaimer: I didn't play much sports growing up, but I'm guessing if I had at least played, say basketball, I would have also done a few others as well.)

Meanwhile, video game creators are also hard at work trying to figure out how to keep people's brains engaged.  They have a very real profit motive not to let you turn off your brain to learning your way around their video game world.  This is why video games are challenging but not too hard (or else you give up in frustration), not too easy (or else you get bored), and there are plenty of power-ups along the way.

Sometimes, thinking about lifelong learning as a video game can bring clarity to where we are in the world.  The main difference is that the power-ups you get in real life don't go away when you close your eyes.  (The flip side is that consequences are also real -- be careful because there's no starting over.)  But I want to focus on the power-ups, which is the point of these emails: showing you where and how to find them.  Plus, when you really know how to do something, it looks like magic to everyone else.

Right now I'm also learning command line stuff on some new and unfamiliar tools (learning how to set up a virtual environment for Python and Django), so I'm also feeling the pain.
